## Step 1: Your First {{ tool_display }} Workflow

Your team has set up a basic {{ tool_display }} configuration to manage repository labels. This is your first hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code - you'll run the standard {{ tool_display }} workflow commands to see how code becomes infrastructure. The configuration is already prepared, so you can focus on understanding the process.

### üìñ Theory: Understanding {{ tool_display }} Workflow

The {{ tool_display }} workflow follows a predictable pattern: initialize, plan, and apply. This three-step process ensures safe infrastructure changes by first downloading required providers, then showing you what will change, and finally executing those changes. You'll start with a simple repository label to understand this fundamental workflow.

- `{{ tool_cmd }} init` downloads providers and prepares your workspace
- `{{ tool_cmd }} plan` shows you what changes {{ tool_display }} will make
- `{{ tool_cmd }} apply` executes the planned changes to create or modify infrastructure
- {{ tool_display }} manages state to track what resources it controls

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Startup Development Environment

1. Start your codespace and explore the workspace
1. Examine the pre-configured `main.tf` file structure
1. Review the {{ tool_display }} configuration syntax and understand what each section does
1. Familiarize yourself with the GitHub provider and issue label resource

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Run Your First {{ tool_display }} Workflow

1. Run `{{ tool_cmd }} init` to initialize the configuration
1. Run `{{ tool_cmd }} plan` to see what will be created
1. Run `{{ tool_cmd }} apply` to create the repository label
1. Verify the label was created in your repository

<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

- If `{{ tool_cmd }} init` fails, check that you have internet connectivity for downloading providers
- If `{{ tool_cmd }} plan` shows no changes, verify your `main.tf` file contains the issue label resource
- If `{{ tool_cmd }} apply` fails with authentication errors, ensure your GitHub token is properly configured
- Check the repository's "Issues" tab and then "Labels" to verify the label was created
